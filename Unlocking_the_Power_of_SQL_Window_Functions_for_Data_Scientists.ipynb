        "#### Section 5: Performance Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "Window functions are immensely powerful, but this power comes at a costâ€”these operations can be resource-intensive and may lead to performance bottlenecks if not used judiciously. Below are some key considerations to optimize the performance of your queries involving window functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 1. Understanding Query Execution Plan\n",
        "\n",
        "The SQL query execution plan gives you a roadmap of how your query gets executed and what steps the database engine takes to retrieve the required data. Being familiar with the execution plan can help you understand how your window function is affecting query performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Spool Operations**: Look for spool operations in your query plan, as they indicate temporary storage usage, which can be costly.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Parallelism**: Window functions might prevent parallel execution plans. Be aware of this if youâ€™re running queries on multi-core database systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 2. Indexing Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "The effectiveness of window functions can be significantly influenced by how well the underlying data is indexed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ordered Index**: Having an index on columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause of the window function can improve performance.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Partition Index**: An index on the columns used in the `PARTITION BY` clause can also expedite data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3. Limit the Scope\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoid running window functions over the entire dataset if you only need a subset of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Row Preceding/Following**: Be specific about the window frame by using `ROWS BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND M FOLLOWING` to limit the rows considered in calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```sql\n",
        "    SELECT runs,\n",
        "           AVG(runs) OVER (ORDER BY start_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)\n",
        "    FROM cricket_data\n",
        "    WHERE season = '2021';\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 4. Filter Early\n",
        "\n",
        "Apply filters as early as possible to reduce the size of the result set over which the window function operates.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Subqueries or CTEs**: Use subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to filter data before applying window functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```sql\n",
        "    WITH FilteredData AS (\n",
        "      SELECT * FROM cricket_data WHERE season = '2021'\n",
        "    )\n",
        "    SELECT striker, AVG(runs) OVER (PARTITION BY striker)\n",
        "    FROM FilteredData;\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 5. Batch Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "For extremely large datasets, consider breaking the operation into smaller batches to improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Row Limits**: Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to process data in chunks, though be cautious as this might require additional logic for aggregating the final result.\n",
        "\n",
        "By keeping these considerations in mind, you can run window functions more efficiently, ensuring that your data pipelines are both robust and performant.\n"
