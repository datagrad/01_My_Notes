        "Certainly, let's proceed to Section 5, which focuses on Stored Procedures and Triggers in SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Section 5: Stored Procedures and Triggers\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Introduction to Stored Procedures\n",
        "Stored Procedures are pre-compiled SQL statements stored in a database that can be executed on-demand. They are highly useful for encapsulating logic, improving code reusability, and enhancing security. In a data science context, you may use stored procedures to automate common data transformation or analysis tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Creating Stored Procedures: Automating Data Analysis\n",
        "Suppose you often need to find the average runs scored by players in different series in our sample cricket dataset. Instead of writing the SQL query every time, you can encapsulate it in a stored procedure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how you could create such a stored procedure:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "DELIMITER //\n",
        "CREATE PROCEDURE GetAverageRunsBySeries(seriesID INT)\n",
        "BEGIN\n",
        "  SELECT player_id, AVG(runs_scored) AS average_runs\n",
        "  FROM Matches\n",
        "  WHERE series_id = seriesID\n",
        "  GROUP BY player_id;\n",
        "END;\n",
        "//\n",
        "DELIMITER ;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "To call this stored procedure:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CALL GetAverageRunsBySeries(1);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Introduction to Triggers\n",
        "Triggers are special types of stored procedures that run automatically when an event occurs in the database, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. Triggers can be used for enforcing business rules, validating input data, or keeping audit trails.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Creating Triggers: Maintaining Data Integrity\n",
        "Imagine you want to ensure that no player can have runs scored below zero in our sample 'Matches' table. You could use a trigger to enforce this rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how to create such a trigger:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "DELIMITER //\n",
        "CREATE TRIGGER CheckRunsScored\n",
        "BEFORE INSERT ON Matches\n",
        "FOR EACH ROW\n",
        "BEGIN\n",
        "  IF NEW.runs_scored < 0 THEN\n",
        "    SET NEW.runs_scored = 0;\n",
        "  END IF;\n",
        "END;\n",
        "//\n",
        "DELIMITER ;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, if you try to insert a record with negative runs, the trigger will automatically set it to zero:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "INSERT INTO Matches VALUES (4, 1, 1, -10);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "After this insert, the `runs_scored` will be stored as 0, thanks to the trigger.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Conclusion for Section 5\n",
        "Stored Procedures and Triggers are powerful features in SQL that can greatly assist in automating repetitive tasks and maintaining data integrity, respectively. In a data science environment, these can be particularly useful for automating data analysis pipelines and ensuring the quality of the data you're working with.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging these advanced SQL features, you can bring more automation and reliability into your data manipulation and analysis tasks, using our cricket series dataset as a practical example.\n",
        "\n",
        "This concludes our exploration of Stored Procedures and Triggers. In the upcoming sections, we'll delve into additional advanced SQL topics to further bolster your data science skills. Stay tuned!"
