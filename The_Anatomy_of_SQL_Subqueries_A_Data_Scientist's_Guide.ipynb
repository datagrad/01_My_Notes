        "A SQL Subquery, also known as a nested or inner query, is a query within another SQL query. Subqueries enable you to perform more complex tasks and answer multi-layered questions, all within a single SQL command. Let's start by classifying subqueries into different types based on their use-cases and the kind of data they return.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Types of Subqueries  \n",
        "1. **Scalar Subqueries**: These return a single value.  \n",
        "2. **Row Subqueries**: These return a single row with multiple columns.  \n",
        "3. **Column Subqueries**: These return a single column but with multiple rows.  \n",
        "4. **Table Subqueries**: These return entire tables.\n",

        "### Section 2: When to Use Subqueries?\n",
        "In SQL, there are often multiple ways to achieve the same result. Subqueries are most effective when:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **You need to retrieve a single value for further calculations**: Scalar subqueries are perfect for this.\n",
        "2. **You are dealing with hierarchical or relational data**: Subqueries can simplify complex joins.\n",
        "3. **You want to perform calculations that involve multiple steps**: Subqueries can break down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example: Finding the Top Scorer's Average Runs in a Season  \n",
        "Here, we first find out who the top scorer in the '2007/08' season is and then calculate their average runs. We'll use a scalar subquery to find the top scorer and a main query to find their average runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT striker, AVG(runs)\n",
        "FROM cricket_data\n",
        "WHERE season = '2007/08' AND striker = (\n",
        "  SELECT striker\n",
        "  FROM cricket_data\n",
        "  WHERE season = '2007/08'\n",
        "  GROUP BY striker\n",
        "  ORDER BY SUM(runs) DESC\n",
        "  LIMIT 1\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Section 3: Correlated Subqueries  \n",
        "A correlated subquery is a subquery that uses values from the outer query. Essentially, the inner query depends on the outer query.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example: Finding Players Who Scored More Than Their Team's Average  \n",
        "In this example, we want to find out the players who have scored more than the average runs scored by their team in the '2007/08' season.\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT striker, runs, batting_team\n",
        "FROM cricket_data AS outer_query\n",
        "WHERE season = '2007/08'\n",
        "AND runs > (\n",
        "  SELECT AVG(runs)\n",
        "  FROM cricket_data AS inner_query\n",
        "  WHERE inner_query.batting_team = outer_query.batting_team\n",
        "  AND inner_query.season = '2007/08'\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the inner query is correlated with the outer query, as it uses `batting_team` from the outer query to calculate the team's average runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Section 4: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them  \n",
        "Subqueries can be powerful but also tricky. Here are some common pitfalls:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Nesting too Deep**: The deeper you nest your subqueries, the harder they are to read and maintain. Try to limit the nesting levels.\n",
        "2. **Performance**: Subqueries can sometimes lead to inefficient queries. Always test the performance of your queries.\n",
        "3. **Debugging**: Debugging nested subqueries can be difficult. It's a good practice to test each subquery individually.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example: Debugging a Complex Subquery  \n",
        "If you encounter issues with a complex subquery, you can isolate each subquery and run it independently to verify its output. For instance, in the correlated subquery example above, you could first run the inner query to ensure it gives you the average runs for a specific team.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Section 5: Subqueries vs Joins  \n",
        "Subqueries and joins often serve similar purposes, but they aren't always interchangeable. Here's how to decide when to use which:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Use Subqueries When**:  \n",
        "    - You need to perform a calculation before the main query.\n",
        "    - You want to pull data from multiple tables that aren't directly related.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Use Joins When**:  \n",
        "    - You're combining rows from different tables based on a related column.\n",
        "    - You don't need to perform calculations before the main query.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example: Using a Join Instead of a Subquery  \n",
        "Here's how you could find players who scored more than their team's average runs in the '2007/08' season using a JOIN:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT o.striker, o.runs, o.batting_team\n",
        "FROM cricket_data AS o\n",
        "JOIN (\n",
        "  SELECT batting_team, AVG(runs) AS team_avg\n",
        "  FROM cricket_data\n",
        "  WHERE season = '2007/08'\n",
        "  GROUP BY batting_team\n",
        ") AS i\n",
        "ON o.batting_team = i.batting_team\n",
        "WHERE o.runs > i.team_avg\n",
        "AND o.season = '2007/08';\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion  \n",
        "Subqueries are an essential tool for data scientists who aim to write versatile, efficient, and clean SQL code. Mastering subqueries can significantly streamline your data manipulation and extraction tasks, making you more proficient in dealing with complex datasets like our cricket series example. Whether you're calculating aggregates, filtering data, or dealing with hierarchical data, subqueries offer a robust way to simplify your SQL queries while also making them more powerful.\n",
