EDA is often the first step in data analysis, helping analysts and data scientists understand their data before diving into more complex modeling or hypothesis testing.\n",

        "**Importance of EDA:**\n",
        "\n",

        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and analyzing a dataset before proceeding with further analysis or modeling. Here are the possible steps you can take for EDA on the given DataFrame `df` with the specified columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initial Inspection:**\n",
        "   - Display the first few rows of the DataFrame using `df.head()` to get an overview of the data's structure and values.\n",
        "   - Use `df.info()` to get information about the data types, non-null counts, and memory usage of each column.\n",
        "   - Check the shape of the DataFrame using `df.shape` to see the number of rows and columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Summary Statistics:**\n",
        "   - Calculate basic summary statistics using `df.describe()` to understand measures like mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and percentiles of numerical columns.\n",
        "   - Use `df.describe(include='all')` to include information about categorical columns as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Cleaning:**\n",
        "   - Identify and handle missing values using `df.isnull().sum()` to count the number of missing values in each column.\n",
        "   - Consider strategies for dealing with missing values, such as imputing with mean, median, or mode, or removing rows/columns with excessive missing data.\n",
        "   - Handle duplicate rows using `df.duplicated()` and remove them with `df.drop_duplicates()` if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Visualization:**\n",
        "   - Create histograms or density plots for numerical variables using `df.hist()` or `sns.histplot()` to visually inspect data distributions.\n",
        "   - Visualize the distribution of categorical variables using bar plots (`sns.countplot()`).\n",
        "   - Use scatter plots (`plt.scatter()` or `sns.scatterplot()`) to explore relationships between numerical variables.\n",
        "   - Create box plots (`sns.boxplot()`) to identify potential outliers in numerical columns and better understand their spread.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Outlier Detection and Treatment:**\n",
        "   - Identify outliers using statistical methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-score.\n",
        "   - Decide whether to remove outliers, transform them, or keep them based on their impact on analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
        "   - Create new features that might provide deeper insights or simplify analysis. For example, derive a new column indicating if the property is located in a popular area based on the `latitude` and `longitude`.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Correlation Analysis:**\n",
        "   - Calculate the correlation matrix using `df.corr()` to quantify relationships between numerical variables.\n",
        "   - Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap (`sns.heatmap()`) to identify strong positive/negative correlations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Distribution Analysis:**\n",
        "   - Use probability plots (`stats.probplot()` from SciPy) to check if numerical variables follow a normal distribution.\n",
        "   - Apply transformations (like logarithmic or power transformations) to make data more closely resemble a normal distribution if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Time Series Analysis (if applicable):**\n",
        "   - If relevant columns have a time component, use line plots or time series decomposition to identify trends, seasonality, and cyclical patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Grouping and Aggregation:**\n",
        "   - Group the data using categorical variables with `groupby()` to calculate summary statistics for specific groups.\n",
        "   - Aggregate functions like `mean()`, `sum()`, or `count()` can provide insights into patterns within subgroups.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Data Visualization (Advanced):**\n",
        "   - Create advanced visualizations like pair plots (`sns.pairplot()`) to explore relationships between multiple numerical variables simultaneously.\n",
        "   - Utilize violin plots (`sns.violinplot()`) to visualize distributions of a numerical variable across different categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Geospatial Analysis (if applicable):**\n",
        "   - If your data includes geographical information, use libraries like Folium or Plotly to create interactive maps that reveal spatial trends and patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Hypothesis Testing (if applicable):**\n",
        "   - If you have specific hypotheses, perform appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to determine if observed differences are statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Final Insights:**\n",
        "   - Summarize key findings and insights obtained from EDA.\n",
        "   - Clearly communicate any patterns, trends, outliers, or relationships you've identified.\n",
        "   - Use these insights to inform subsequent steps in data analysis or modeling.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Distribution analysis involves understanding the distribution of a variable, which describes how its values are spread or concentrated. It's important for understanding the central tendencies, variability, and shape of the data. By analyzing the distribution of variables, you can identify potential outliers, assess the need for data transformation, and make informed decisions about modeling and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why is Distribution Analysis Required?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Identify Outliers:** Distribution analysis helps you identify extreme values (outliers) that might need further investigation or treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Transformation:** Understanding the distribution can guide decisions about data transformation (e.g., log transformation) to make the data more suitable for certain analyses or models.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Assumptions:** Many statistical models assume that the data is normally distributed. Distribution analysis helps you determine if your data meets these assumptions.\n",
